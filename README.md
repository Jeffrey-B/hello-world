# hello-world
My name is Jeffrey Bennett, I am a fourth year environmental engineering student from New Zealand. 
I have an interest in programming andI have begun the journey of learning Python.
I have been following Corey Schafers youtube series of begginer tutorials.
I would highly reccomend checking out his begginer series for anybody learning python as his method of explanation and execution is concise and simple.
Great to be part of the comunity and I'm excited to start some small projects and expand my knowledge.
